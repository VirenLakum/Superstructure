# Superstructure
SuperStructure combines linkedList, hashMap and AVL binary tree to take advantage of all 3 data structures. So this complex structure can now maintain insertion order, has O(1) read time and is also sorted in nature. However, it comes with a little overhead when it comes to insertion time for given benefits, but it is a small price to pay.
